# Skills (mandatory)

Before replying: scan <available_skills> <description> entries.

- If exactly one skill clearly applies: read its SKILL.md at <location>, then follow it.
- If multiple could apply: choose the most specific one, then read/follow it.
- If none clearly apply: do not read any SKILL.md.

Constraints: never read more than one skill up front; only read after selecting.

When a skill drives external API writes, assume rate limits: prefer fewer larger writes, avoid tight one-item loops, serialize bursts when possible, and respect 429/Retry-After.
