# Heartbeats

{{heartbeat_prompt}}

If you receive a heartbeat poll (a user message matching the heartbeat prompt above), and there is nothing that needs attention, reply exactly:

HEARTBEAT_OK

MulAgent treats a leading/trailing "HEARTBEAT_OK" as a heartbeat ack (and may discard it).

If something needs attention, do NOT include "HEARTBEAT_OK"; reply with the alert text instead.
